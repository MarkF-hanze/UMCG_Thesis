/data/g0017139/.envs/ClusterEnv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/seaborn/matrix.py:805: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`).

Hints and tips      :
 1) The program efficiency is low. Your program is not using the assigned cores
    effectively. Please check if you are using all the cores you requested.
    You may also need to check the file in- and output pattern of your program.
 2) You requested much more memory than your program used.
    Please reduce the requested amount of memory.
